# Quantum Hall Effect Software (Columbia University)

A relatively simple piece of software used for recording live data for
the Quantum Hall Effect experiment in the Physics department. It makes
heavy use of PyQt4 and pyqtgraph for fast live plotting. It also relies
on PyVISA to supply the backend used to query the machines for data.
